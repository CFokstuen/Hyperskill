## Python
### Hangman
"Hangman is a popular yet grim puzzle game. A cruel computer hides a word from you, which you try to guess letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be “hanged”. If you win, you'll survive. You’ve probably played the game at least once or twice. Now you can actually create this game yourself!"

Hangman uses the random module, loops, lists, functions, and other variables.

### Simple Chatty Bot
"Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!"

Simple Chaaty Bot focuses on the basic syntax of Python, variable, conditions, loops, and functions.

### Zookeeper
"This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status."

Zookeeper uses syntax basics, variables, data storage types, and while loops.

### My First Project
"You are an owner of a new small corner shop. You are doing well and want to determine how much you earned in the first month. Create a simple tool that will calculate your net income!"

My First Project uses integer artimetic, variables, and taking user data.

### Loan Calculator
"Personal finances are an important part of life. Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Let’s make a program that can help us with that!"

Loan Calculator applies mathematics, and explores the use of third-party libraries and modules with simulated financial instruments. Additionally, parse arguements, and command-line interface is applied.
