## Python
### Hangman
"Hangman is a popular yet grim puzzle game. A cruel computer hides a word from you, which you try to guess letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be “hanged”. If you win, you'll survive. You’ve probably played the game at least once or twice. Now you can actually create this game yourself!"

Hangman uses the random module, loops, lists, functions, and other variables.

### Simple Chatty Bot
"Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!"

Simple Chaaty Bot focuses on the basic syntax of Python, variable, conditions, loops, and functions.

### Zookeeper
"This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status."

Zookeeper uses syntax basics, variables, data storage types, and while loops.
